Subject: [PATCH] Pass LD_GOLD=1 via makefile to enable gold linker

Current logic prefers gold if a toolchain has gold linker installed and
does not offer any option to chose default linker which might not be
gold linker. Its better to pass this control to user instead of auto
detecting and deciding.
